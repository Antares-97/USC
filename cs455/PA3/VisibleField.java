/**
  VisibleField class
  This is the data that's being displayed at any one point in the game (i.e., visible field, because it's what the
  user can see about the minefield), Client can call getStatus(row, col) for any square.
  It actually has data about the whole current state of the game, including  
  the underlying mine field (getMineField()).  Other accessors related to game status: numMinesLeft(), isGameOver().
  It also has mutators related to actions the player could do (resetGameDisplay(), cycleGuess(), uncover()),
  and changes the game state accordingly.
  
  It, along with the MineField (accessible in mineField instance variable), forms
  the Model for the game application, whereas GameBoardPanel is the View and Controller, in the MVC design pattern.
  It contains the MineField that it's partially displaying.  That MineField can be accessed (or modified) from 
  outside this class via the getMineField accessor.
