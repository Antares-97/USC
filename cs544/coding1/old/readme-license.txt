README for the data used in Coding Assignment 1, USC course CSCI-544 (Applied Natural Language Processing), Fall 2020.

This package contains several lists with fictional names of couples and individuals. These are not names of real people. The lists were created by an original program written by Ron Artstein in August 2020, for use in a class exercise. The program which created the lists uses statistical properties derived from data which were downloaded from the following web pages:

# https://namecensus.com/female_names_alpha.htm (accessed 2020-08-14)
# https://namecensus.com/male_names_alpha.htm (accessed 2020-08-14)
# https://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/2010surnames/names.zip (accessed 2020-08-17)

The web site https://www2.census.gov belongs to the U.S. government, and the data on it are presumed to be in the public domain under U.S. law.

The web site https://namecensus.com claims copyright to all the contents on the site, and allows download of material for "personal, informational, and non-commercial purposes". It also states that "Data used on namecensus has been derived, excerpted, and extracted from public U.S. government sources." Such sources are presumed to be in the public domain.

Since the program only uses statistical properties of the downloaded data, and these data are in the public domain, I consider the name lists created by the program to not constitute a "derivative work" of the copyrighted material on https://namecensus.com, but rather a work based on public domain data.

Out of an abundance of caution, I do not authorize further distribution of the name lists.

The program used for creating the name lists is not released at this time.
